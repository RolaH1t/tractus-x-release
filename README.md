# Eclipse Tractus-X

This is the central [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx) release repository.
As Eclipse Tractus-X contains multiply components / products, this repository reflects the
unified official release of the Eclipse Tractus-X distribution.

## Minimum requirement

Eclipse Tractus-X components are based on modern cloud technology and require a current Kubernetes Cluster. You need to be able to install Helm Charts. For supported Kubernetes Versions and technical details, please refer to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and to the product specific README.md.

## How to install Eclipse Tractus-X

All components are based on [Helm](https://helm.sh/) Charts. To find the right versions of them, see our overarching [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for versions which are compatible with each other because they have been tested and released together. All components have their own installation guides.

## Schedule

Tractus-X releases follow a quarterly schedule. In addition to the overarching quarterly release, single product
releases take place on demand.
The overarching release is done to ensure compatibility, quality standards and alignment between Eclipse Tractus-X products.
